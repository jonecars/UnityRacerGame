# Overview

This is my first time using a game engine.  I wanted to learn about how that works. I wanted to learn about how the physics work in Unity.  In this project I specifically learned more about how to use rigidbody, transform, and mesh colliders.

I created a car obstacle-dodging game.  To play the game you need to build and launch the game from Unity. Once created you can use the .exe to play the game.

# Development Environment

C# was used with Unity to create the project. Visual Studio was used to create the scripts for the game.
The Unity asset store helped in getting objects like the car and obstacles.

* Also used Unity prebuilt tutorial games inside of unity hub.
* A few other youtube tutorials were used to help with Github and Music.

# Future Work

* I would like to add levels.  However this does not take to much time now that I have prefabs saved.
* I would like to add a level select screen.  
* I need to put a volume slider bar in the main menu (options)
